Hey guys this is jsut a test, seeing if I can try to push something

Ok this is another thing of note, before you work on the project, pull the files to make sure you're up to date. Be sure to also communicate if you are working on the project and what changes you've made, as well as make sure your git commit -m message is detailed enough for us all to get what happened and stuff like that.
